### Setting up MQTT on a headless Raspberry Pi and connecting it to TrigX IOT platform

In this Tutorial we will : 
- Install Raspbian Strech Lite on headless Raspberry Pi 3 Model B
- Set up WiFi on Raspberry Pi
- Install Mosquitto (MQTT Server) on Raspberry Pi
- Register Devices & Channles on the TrigXIOT platform
- Connect Raspberry Pi with TrigX IOT Platform


*** To follow this tutorial you will need a computer, Raspberry Pi (I have RPi 3 Model B), microSD card and WiFi connection.

**Note:** The Console does not yet work in on IPhones

## Developer DIY Tools

While actively developing an IoT project or product, the Console offers
many helpful features to make prototyping a breeze. See the last time a
device connected, debug a firmware issue by observing event logs,
set up a webhook to send data to an external service, and more.

### Devices

The Devices page allows you to see a list of the devices associated with
your account. Here, you can see specific information about each device,
including it's unique Device ID, it's name, the type of device (i.e.
Photon or Electron) the last time it connected
to the TrigX IOT cloud, and whether or not the device is currently
online.
